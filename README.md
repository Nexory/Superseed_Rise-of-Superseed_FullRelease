## 🎮 Game Overview

In the war-torn land of **Ethara**, you’re tasked with building an army to protect your base and crush the enemy’s across 25 grueling levels. Once peaceful, Ethara now faces **Bandits**, **Zombies**, and **Undead**, and it’s up to you to reclaim it. Harvest **seeds** from fallen foes, deploy units like **Peasants** and **Tanks**, and use **superseeds** to upgrade your forces—all while racing against relentless waves.

Narrated by **David**, the story unfolds as you battle escalating threats. From the **Bandit King’s** surrender to the **Undead’s** final stand, every level tests your strategy. With saves via `player_data.json` (local) or **localStorage** (web), your progress endures. Can you rise to the top?
